  module Metadata
    # The Field object represents a single FileMaker field. It *does not hold the data* in the field. Instead,
    # it serves as a source of metadata about the field. For example, if you're script is trying to be highly
    # dynamic about its field access, it may need to determine the data type of a field at run time. Here's
    # how:
    #
    #   field_name = "Some Field Name"
    #   case myRecord.fields[field_name].result
    #   when "text"
    #     # it is a text field, so handle appropriately
    #   when "number"
    #     # it is a number field, so handle appropriately
    #   end
    #
    # =Attributes
    #
    # The Field object has the following attributes:
    #
    # * *name* is the name of the field
    #
    # * *result* is the data type of the field; possible values include:
    #   * text
    #   * number
    #   * date
    #   * time
    #   * timestamp
    #   * container
    #
    # * *type* any of these:
    #   * normal (a normal data field)
    #   * calculation
    #   * summary
    #
    # * *max_repeats* is the number of repetitions (1 for a normal field, more for a repeating field)
    #
    # * *global* is +true+ is this is a global field, *false* otherwise
    #
    # Note: Field types match FileMaker's own values, but the terminology differs. The +result+ attribute
    # tells you the data type of the field, regardless of whether it is a calculation, summary, or normal
    # field. So a calculation field whose result type is _timestamp_ would have these attributes:
    #
    # * result: timestamp
    # * type: calculation
    #
    # * *control& is a FieldControl object representing the sytle and value list information associated
    #   with this field on the layout.
    #
    # Note: Since a field can sometimes appear on a layout more than once, +control+ may be an Array.
    # If you don't know ahead of time, you'll need to deal with this. One easy way is:
    #
    #   controls = [myField.control].flatten
    #   controls.each {|control|
    #     # do something with the control here
    #   }
    #
    # The code above makes sure the control is always an array. Typically, though, you'll know up front
    # if the control is an array or not, and you can code accordingly.
